Here is a detailed overview of its key features and specifications:
Solar Panel Configuration
The trailer is equipped with three high-efficiency mono-crystalline solar panels, each with a capacity of 435W. This configuration ensures optimal energy harvesting from the sun, providing a continuous and clean power supply for the entire system. The total solar output is 1,305W, which is more than sufficient to power the onboard surveillance equipment and charge the batteries.
Battery Storage
At the heart of the system is a bank of six 150Ah gel batteries, designed to store 10,800Wh of energy. These deep-cycle batteries are connected in a 12V DC configuration, ensuring a reliable and consistent power supply for the trailer's operations. The gel technology used in these batteries offers superior performance and longevity compared to traditional lead-acid batteries.
Surveillance and Lighting
The CCTV mounting box, equipped with two high-resolution cameras, is strategically positioned at the top of the mast for a panoramic view of the surrounding area. To enhance visibility and deter unwanted activities, the box is fitted with two white and blue strobe lights. These lights provide a strong visual presence and can be activated as needed.
Cable Management
The trailer is well-wired with a combination of CAT6 cables, 2.5mm¬≤, and 1.5mm¬≤ power cables. This ensures a robust and reliable connection for data transmission and power distribution throughout the system. The use of high-quality cables guarantees minimal signal loss and maximum efficiency.
